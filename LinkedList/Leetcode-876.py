'''Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.


Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
 
Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
1 <= Node.val <= 100'''

    # while cur is not None:
    #     length+=1
    #     cur=cur.next
    # n=length//2
    # cur=head
    # for i in range(n):
    #     cur=cur.next
